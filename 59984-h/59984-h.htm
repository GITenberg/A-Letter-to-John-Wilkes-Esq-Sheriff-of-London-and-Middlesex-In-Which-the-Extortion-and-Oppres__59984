<p>A <span class="smcap">Dedication</span> seems as necessary to
a publication as legitimacy to a child; but as I have no blown-up
fool to flatter, no private end to answer, no itch to become an
author, thirst for praise, nor dread of censure, I shall
therefore commit the annexed sheets to your protection; in the
course of which the reader will find my pen a most faithful
amanuensis to truth.&nbsp; And if so weak a monitor contributes
but a mite to general utility, the end is fulfilled; if no, the
intention is equally laudable.&nbsp; I have sowed the seeds of
reformation; it is you must manure the land, and give the
increase.&nbsp; The task is undertook at infinite peril; an
accumulation of enemies <a name="pagevi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vi</span>enemies is the certain consequence,
whilst a creation of friends amounts not to a glimmering
hope.&nbsp; To raise a party or private emolument, I have quitted
the turnpike-road, and omitted every thing necessary for the
purpose; viz. libelling the most respectable characters in the
nation, and giving scurrility and falshood a preference to
truth.</p>
<p>It may be said with more envy than justice, that the subject
matter is but the consequence of a private quarrel between the
author and <span class="GutSmall">ONE</span> of the parties
alluded to.&nbsp; Such squibs of malice, and other obstacles of
the like nature, I am well aware of, and am provided with proper
artillery to combat all such opposition.&nbsp; It is therefore
necessary to declare, that I took chambers in Gray&rsquo;s-Inn
with a settled purpose of detecting the numerous and enormous <a
name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>abuses and
cruelties contained in the following treatise.</p>
<p>How I came to fail in the undertaking, my Letter to the
Citizens of London fully explains.</p>
<p>The seizing my furniture, books, papers, and every thing I was
possessed of, under <span class="smcap">Pretence</span> of debt,
and the more flagrant <span class="smcap">Pretence</span> of
<span class="smcap">Execution</span>, together with the
dispossessing me of my habitation, will neither serve to prevent
the subscribing myself of Gray&rsquo;s-Inn, or continuing there,
if a <span class="smcap">Grain</span> of <span

is to be found in a <span class="smcap">Ton</span> of <span

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span><span
class="GutSmall">TO</span><br />
JOHN WILKES, Esq;</h2>
<p>SIR,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is an innate satisfaction in
human nature that will ever manifest itself when occasion
presents the tribute of praise to our actions, and a generous
mind feels an equal degree of pleasure in paying that tribute in
the coin of truth; but the ambiguity of your actions renders
their construction so doubtful, there is much hazard in giving or
denying them approbation.&nbsp; Whilst the boisterous malevolence
of your enemies load you with vices foreign to your heart, the
fanatic adulation of your zealots as fervently extol you for
virtues <span class="GutSmall">WE</span> know not of.&nbsp;
Opinions diametrically opposite in general are but hyperboles
created and cherished by the violence of party, and at best leave
an hypothesis too intricate to <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>draw any conclusion of real principles
or motives from.&nbsp; It is therefore not altogether
unpardonable if a writer should err in the portrait of a
character so equivocal.&nbsp; In two things however the people of
all degrees, interest, and principles seem to concur; namely,
that the advantage derived from your conduct has heretofore been
merely accidental, and that if your integrity could keep pace
with your abilities, this nation might justly boast an ornament
unknown to others; whether either or both these conjectures bear
the testimony of truth your own heart can best determine;
nevertheless it is indisputably evident that we have not
witnessed one premeditated or intentional benefit, independent of
your own personal and private interest, flowing from a course of
eight years patriotism; how far your endeavours may have fell
short of your assiduity and inclination in the pursuit of any
public good, I will not contest.&nbsp; The multitude have long
been taught to consider you as an oracle pregnant with miracles
eventually as their different imaginations represented them; as
yet those sanguine expectations are totally unanswered: it is
therefore absolutely necessary to do something either to <span
class="GutSmall">SERVE</span> or <span
class="GutSmall">DECEIVE</span>, no matter which.&nbsp; Credulity
is the characteristic of Englishmen, <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>who as greedily swallow the deception
as the service.&nbsp; They have entertained a most sovereign
respect for the hacknied and prostituted word <span
class="smcap">Liberty</span>, without a comprehension of any
property or meaning peculiar to that admirable substantive more
than the bare found; to evince this truth we need only look back
and view the innumerable stabs given to the vitals of Liberty in
those very moments they meant to celebrate her triumph over
Tyranny.&nbsp; The seizure of your person and papers with a
general warrant furnished us with one instance of ministerial
oppression, or rather ministerial ignorance; to remedy which we
have seen the misguided advocates of Liberty committing every
species of violence without any warrant at all, spurning the
authority of magistrates, and attempting a total subversion of
that order and government so absolutely necessary to <span
class="smcap">Genuine Liberty</span>, the certain effects of a
bigoted enthusiasm.&nbsp; Liberty in itself is the balm of life
to an Englishman; but, like physic prescribed for our health, if
treated with judgment, preserves the frame; if not, turns to
poison and destroys it.&mdash;Our excellent constitution has
rendered this inestimable jewel the birth-right and inheritance
of the meanest subject, not in proportion to our other
enjoyments, but in such equal lots, that the <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>peasant shares
with the prince.&nbsp; The thing itself is the same in king or
subject, the difference only subsists in the mode of obtaining
and using it.&nbsp; A due reverence to the laws of the land on
which Liberty is founded, and a proper respect to the ministers
acting judicially under lawful authority, is the most eligible
method of preserving our privileges, whilst an impartial
distribution and faithful interpretation of those laws will most
assuredly prove a sufficient bulwark against all infringements or
attacks of tyranny.&nbsp; Nor need we have any
<i>apprehensions</i> for contrary events, but from a spirit of
sedition amongst ourselves.&nbsp; When anarchy supersedes order
and subordination, when the laws become trampled on and violated,
when right and wrong have lost their distinction, and justice and
injustice are melted down into the same mass, Liberty will perish
in the confused chaos, and we shall inevitably become slaves
unpitied, inasmuch that we have voluntarily sapped the foundation
of freedom, and forged the chains of our own bondage.</p>
<p>Thus much, Sir, I held absolutely necessary by way of
introduction, and for two special reasons; first, to manifest my
independence of party zeal; and secondly, to <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>shew my esteem
for the laws before I venture to censure the execution of
them.</p>
<p>I shall now proceed, with a candid mediocrity between the
extremes of violent prejudice and blind partiality, to point out
a grievance of a most oppressive nature, which the common people
have long groaned under and complained of to no purpose.&nbsp; As
this is a species of oppression falling immediately under your
own absolute power in some measure (as sheriff) to redress
(independent of ministerial mandates or influence) we shall
therefore look upon your endeavours to remove the injuries and
establish a remedy as the touch-stone or standard of your
affection and gratitude to a people who have deserved both on
many occasions.&nbsp; It is evident you was apprized of the
infinite abuses committed by sheriffs officers previous to your
election, and that these abuses called loudly for redress;
therefore you very judiciously made a public declaration,
&ldquo;that the rectifying such intolerable cruelties should be
considered as the condition of your election.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having
thus pledged your veracity for the due performance of so
necessary and interesting a contract, we wait with some
impatience the redemption of this solemn pawn.&nbsp; The hour is
now approaching which <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>will provide you fair opportunity of
riveting the affection of your friends and contemning the malice
of your enemies.</p>
<p>In an undertaking so truly laudable and beneficial to the
lives, liberties, and property of your fellow citizens and
subjects, you cannot doubt the assistance of every friend to
justice.&nbsp; Experience has furnished me with a plentiful stock
of such materials most necessary to lay the foundation and
ground-work of your intended plan, and I shall most cheerfully
transfer them when called on.&nbsp; Though notwithstanding such
assistance, joined to your own unparalleled intrepidity,
sagacity, and acquaintance with the laws, I fear the talk of
reformation will prove too arduous for your single efforts.&nbsp;
That you may form a more perfect idea of the difficulties you
have to encounter, I shall set before your view the rise,
progress, abilities, strength, and preposterous magnitude of a
modern sheriff&rsquo;s officer.&nbsp; This excrement of the law
is in general the outcast of bagnios and more infamous brothels,
or the vomit of every gaol within the bills of mortality; if he
can boast a seven years tour to America, it is an acquisition to
his pretentions.&nbsp; Let this be as it may, certain it is, that
they most carefully unload themselves of every tender sensation
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>and feeling
incident to human nature to render their conscience light enough
for a thorough bailiff.&nbsp; Bawdy-house keepers, or other
persons of equal reputation, find it their interest to stand
security to the sheriffs, the clerks in whole office, after
receiving the necessary perquisite and treat, admit him to the
vocation of his profession; being thus constituted a minister of
justice <i>durante bene placito</i>, and having been regularly
initiated in the principles of thieving from his cradle, he
begins the plundering trade, as if licensed pursuant to act of
parliament, under the cherishing wings of the law, provided with
the annexed indispensible implements of his profession; viz. ten
of his primitive companions, by way of a <i>corps de reserve</i>,
when on the forlorn hope, <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a> a thorough-paced
pettyfogging attorney, an infamous broker, whose conscience
exceeds not the price of a rush chair, and <i>a very
reputable</i>, <i>worthy</i>, monied-man, whose successful <span
class="smcap">Villanies</span> have enabled him to advance a sum
on every occasion that offers a <span class="smcap">Victim</span>
to his <i>Friendship</i>.&nbsp; The diabolical band of this
demi-pluto being thus arraigned, and his houshold <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>established
under the inspection of a female with principles of the same
dimension, the inquisition opens, and the tortures begin on the
first unhappy object that falls in their clutches, who is no
sooner brought home (as the phrase is) but surrounded by this
flock of harpies.&nbsp; The attorney attends in capacity of
midwife to his misfortunes, and most carefully delivers him of
all his secrets, such as, how much property he is possessed of,
how much he owes, and many other particulars very material to
him; the bottle is pushed briskly about, and the prisoner is made
to believe he is amongst his best friends.&nbsp; The first and
principal point is gained when they have prevailed on him not to
pay or settle the debt.&nbsp; If he wants money a <i>worthy
honest</i> man attends, who will lend it him, doing these things
frequently to men in his situation.&nbsp; Five different messages
are sent to his acquaintances to bail him; the messenger
<i>mistakes</i> the way, and goes to his other creditors for more
writs; the prisoner is charged a shilling or half a crown for
each of those <i>services</i>.&nbsp; Unluckily his friends were
out&mdash;but what of that!&nbsp; Mr. &mdash; and Mr. &mdash;
shall bail him to-morrow, and the scoundrel of a plaintiff will
never have six pence (the only word of truth he hears).&nbsp;
To-morrow comes, the office is to be searched&mdash;unlucky <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>again! it is a
holiday, or not office-hours, &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp; Now a bill is
brought in of five or six pounds, for which his new acquaintance
have eat and drank well; his pockets stripped paves the way to
stripping his house&mdash;another writ or two is come against him
by these delays.&nbsp; The unhappy man is now fairly in the
trammels&mdash;what must be done!&nbsp; Why, any thing to obtain
liberty.&nbsp; The bailiff&rsquo;s good friends bail him, at the
<i>modest</i> expence of half the debts&mdash;and from that
moment he dates his inevitable ruin.&nbsp; He is soon after
called on to bail some rascal of their own upon a sham action,
who is never to be found afterwards; therefore he must pay the
debt and cost, which is snacked in the <span
class="smcap">Family</span>.&nbsp; If it is inconvenient, out of
pure <i>friendship</i> and <i>humanity</i>, a little time is
given upon a bond and judgment, which is no sooner signed,
&amp;c. but execution is taken out and levied.&nbsp; The
<i>honest</i> broker appraises the effects to one third the
value, the monied <i>friend</i> purchases them under the
sheriff&rsquo;s bill of sale, the deluded wretch is robbed,
beggared, and branded for a villain by his fair creditors, whilst
the attorney, bailiff, broker, and purchaser divide the booty,
and the unhappy debtor is sent to the King&rsquo;s Bench or
Fleet, as an additional proof of <span
class="GutSmall">THEIR</span> industry.&nbsp; But as the same
medicine agrees not <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>with all constitutions, so the same doctrine suits not
all principles, we will for a moment turn our attention to a
fresh disease, and mark the operation of a fresh remedy.&nbsp;
The patient now is a man of large dealings, whose credit is not
quite exhausted, encumbered with a good-looking promising booty;
he is therefore, in consideration of ten <i>per cent.</i>
indulged with a length of tether, and bargains for a lease of
liberty from term to term conditionally, that he neglects his
business, and calls every day to treat his keeper with a bottle
of Madeira, and some other <i>trifling</i> present of five
guineas value for the she Saracen who supplies the place of
hostess to this infernal inquisition.&nbsp; However pernicious
men may esteem those kind of <i>services</i> when at a distance
from the necessity of accepting them, there are few to be found
possessed of sufficient resolution to reject liberty on any
terms.&nbsp; If mankind in general were, Sir, blessed with your
fortitude, they would eagerly concur in this maxim, that the
worst of all danger is the dread on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Misfortunes
gather strength by travelling, and come home loaded with
affliction in proportion to the time they take to reach us;
therefore when we view them, though aloof, it is our interest to
meet, before their burthen becomes too weighty; but the present
<a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>tense is
the most predominant of human passions, and we are too apt to
think, whilst danger is out of sight, it is easily conquered;
hence it is that the unhappy objects in question entail on
themselves a life of misery, by studiously waving the
difficulties of a day.&nbsp; If men in trade, the very instant
they are arrested, would throw their property into the hands of
creditors, they would certainly escape the consequences attending
a different step, which at best is only delaying misery, without
a hope of avoiding it:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Like one who</i>, <i>willing to defer a
while</i><br />
<i>A sudden ruin</i>, <i>props the tottering pile</i>,<br />
<i>Till in short space the house</i>, <i>the props</i>, <i>and
all</i><br />
<i>Together in a dreadful ruin fall</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But to return; more actions come against the prisoner on
parole, and it is necessary to have bail, not as a security to
the plaintiffs, but to augment the bailiff&rsquo;s
emolument.&nbsp; It is a lucky hit if he has no friends ready;
for then the banditti come into pay, and the <span
class="smcap">Harvest</span> begins, which ends not while a
moveable is found on his premises; houshold furniture indeed is
not the great crop aimed at, the unfortunate man is yet in good
credit, and it would be the height of ingratitude to refuse a
compliance with his own destruction, <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>to serve such worthy <i>friends</i>
as his bail; therefore he must accept a bill of 50 or 100l. for
this rascal, another of the like sum for his colleague in
iniquity, otherwise he is in danger of being rendered to
prison.&nbsp; The bills thus obtained are negotiated, and the
consideration sent to the den where they were given, and there
divided by the thieves who inhabit it.&nbsp; The bills become
due&mdash;the acceptor no abilities to pay&mdash;writs are taken
out&mdash;more bail is procured of the same complexion&mdash;more
notes must be given for the same laudable purposes&mdash;more
credulous tradesmen are easily found to take them, and the
product divided as before&mdash;and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>,
till his credit is on a level with their principles.&nbsp; A
statute of bankruptcy at last drops the curtain, and thus ends
the farce before the tragedy is begun.&nbsp; Pettyfogging
attornies, bailiffs, brokers, and thieves of every denomination
have devoured his substance, the creditors are in luck if enough
is left to pay the expence a commission.&nbsp; The bankrupt is
sent to gaol to linger out the remainder of a wretched life, as a
reward for that folly and imprudence, which his creditors
construe fraud and villany.</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>It may
be thought, Sir, that the fertility of my invention supplies the
chasm of bailiffs knavery, and that to indulge an unjustifiable
spleen, I have given my veracity a stretch; indeed there is no
occasion for fiction, I have a most plentiful stock of
substantial, well-attested infamy to cull materials from, and can
produce many men who have gone through this ceremony step by
step, with this variation only, that the scope of villany has
been more extensive, and the catastrophe protracted to a longer
date.&nbsp; Things are strongly misrepresented if a certain
bailiff of Middlesex did not extort bills to the amount of 3000l.
from one man in the afore-mentioned situation.&nbsp; But if these
transactions, infamous as they are, were the ultimate of their
villany, I should hold them so barren of vice as not to merit
censure.&nbsp; Acts of a more alarming and cruel nature are daily
practised by these <span class="smcap">Buccaneers</span> and
<span class="smcap">Hussars</span> of law; I shall therefore
overlook these as supernumerary artifices, bagatelles, and common
garnish to their standing household dish of villanies, and
proceed to a view of their integrity in the execution of a legal
process levied on the effects of a defendant.</p>
<p>The first step in this business is putting from two to any
<i>requisite</i> number of their own <i>worthies</i> in
possession, not to preserve the <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>property, but to swear that no such
property existed, if necessary.&nbsp; The goods are generally
taken off the premises without the <i>tedious</i> form of
appraisement, inventory, or bill of sale from the sheriff; nor is
the difference between the sum levied and the amount of the
property any obstruction, these are niceties to be determined by
law.&nbsp; Taking <span class="GutSmall">ALL</span> the property
they find is, in the Bailiff Dictionary, securing the ammunition
to prevent <span class="GutSmall">A FIRING</span>; the English of
which is, robbing a man of <span class="GutSmall">ALL</span> will
prevent his having any thing left to procure redress.&nbsp; The
burglary thus completed, the plunder is appraised by the <span
class="GutSmall">FAMILY</span> broker, and as formally sold to
another <i>honest</i> chapman in the <span
class="GutSmall">FAMILY</span> way.&nbsp; If the injured party
should fortunately raise a friend to inquire into the nature of
this atrocious robbery, what avails it! the matter comes before
the court&mdash;affidavits innumerable <i>prove</i> the legality
of the whole transaction, and the oppressor triumphs in
victorious villany.&nbsp; Yet a man of common understanding will
answer, how is it possible these depredations can be committed
with impunity, in the face of such excellent laws?&nbsp; I reply,
that the excellency of those laws, and their favourable
interpretation by our judges, &amp;c. renders it almost
impracticable to come at offenders of this class.&nbsp; Whilst <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>affidavits
can be procured at the stinted price of half a crown, to weigh in
testimony against such as are the language of truth, dictated by
conscience only, we have little hopes of redress for injuries of
this stamp, as the complaint must be made by motion on affidavit,
and the reply is made in the same mode, with five affidavits to
one, which lawyers term weight of metal; therefore we may justly
say, the laws designed for our protection are in the hands of
infamous professors, the most grievous evil the subject knows;
the laws of this kingdom, though the most admirable code in the
known world, are but so many implements of oppression to
individuals destitute of abilities to purchase a proper share of
them; a convincing proof that Liberty, unaccompanied with
property, is a <span class="smcap">mere Farce</span>.&nbsp; I
will venture to affirm, that if half these outrages had been
committed in an absolute monarchy, nothing less than the
offender&rsquo;s life would atone for the offence; from what
false notions then do we bear with oppressions unknown and
unheard of even amongst the Algerines, and other countries
distinguished by the badge of slavery?&nbsp; I will maintain
that, to poor individuals, such slavery is virtually <span
class="smcap">Liberty</span> in every <span
class="GutSmall">ADVANTAGEOUS</span> acceptation of the word, in
a more beneficial <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>sense than the subjects of this country
experience.&nbsp; Do not these laws murder the wretch languishing
under the intenseness of hunger, and every other motive that the
wants of human nature can urge, who steals a shilling, at the
same time that they screen a dignified villain, living
luxuriously on the spoils of a whole nation, who, by purchasing a
little well-chewed eloquence at the bar, gets his robberies
graced with the epithets of error and mistake?&nbsp; But, of all
the diabolical practices in the creed of a bailiff and
pettifogger, the breaking open our houses, under <span
class="smcap">Pretence</span> of an execution, is surely the most
shocking, though not the least frequent.&nbsp; This species of
burglary is perpetrated in the following manner: one of their
co-operators is set up a creditor, no matter for what sum; that
circumstance is guided by the amount of the property discovered
on the premises.&nbsp; A writ is immediately sued out, and
another pettifogger accepts the service in the supposed
defendant&rsquo;s name, whom he never saw or heard of.&nbsp; In
this manner the proceedings go on; a declaration is delivered and
received in the like manner, and, to give a better colour to the
transaction, a special plea is put in: in this seemingly regular
mode, execution is taken out and levied on the effects of the
unfortunate <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>object, who is thunder-struck at the event, as well he
may; but expostulating or complaining is fruitless.</p>
<p>The property is either sold on the premises, or taken away for
the same purpose.</p>
<p>The officer takes shelter under his warrant.</p>
<p>The attorney under his client&rsquo;s instructions to sue.</p>
<p>The affair is so managed as to levy the last day of a term,
that no court may be open to a complaint; and before the next
term <span class="smcap">Affidavit&rsquo;s</span> sufficient
<i>prove</i> not only the legality of the debt and proceedings,
but that no such transaction ever happened, if that should be
found most <i>convenient</i>.&nbsp; I have been witness to the
oppression and cruelties exercised in conquered countries, the
misery and wretchedness of the inhabitants living under military
and despotic governments, and to the numerous train of evils
accompanying the seat of war; but never, no never, met with
horrors so dreadful to look on, as are daily perpetrated with
impunity in this country of boasted liberty:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>As well we might the host of armies
bear</i>,<br />
<i>As feel the</i> <span class="GutSmall">EFFECTS</span>, <span
class="GutSmall">DISTRESS</span>, <i>and</i> <span
class="GutSmall">FORCE</span> <i>of war</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Why do
we tell Spain, Portugal, and Italy, that we have neither bravos,
assassins, or inquisitions, when we are cursed with pettyfogging
attornies, bailiffs, and knights of the post, a more numerous and
dangerous left of banditti, who commit every species of barbarity
and cruelty, under the specious pretext of doing their
duty?&nbsp; To what purpose do we daily waste our lungs, and
crack the drum of our ears, bauling at the illegality of <span
class="smcap">General Warrants</span>, which happens once in a
century?</p>
<p>I defy the annals of the secretary of state&rsquo;s office to
produce a General Warrant, or even the records of the Star
Chamber, an order fraught with equal oppression.</p>
<p>If I remember right, the warrant which seized your person and
papers left you quiet possession of every thing else; and even
those papers were returned, with the additional recompence of
<span class="smcap">Four Thousand Pounds</span>: notwithstanding
we look on you as a martyr to ministerial vengeance and
oppression.&nbsp; If so, by what standard of oppression will you
measure the wrongs here complained of?&nbsp; You cannot insult
our understanding so far as to tell us, oppression from one
minister of state is weightier than <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>from fifty ministers of <span
class="smcap">Hell</span>, who not only seize our property,
deemed such by law, but the absolute exceptions in law, papers,
books, and wearing-apparel.</p>
<p>If, Sir, you are not a perfect <span
class="smcap">Mockery</span> of that patriotism you so
industriously persuade us is the spring of <span
class="GutSmall">ALL</span> your actions, if you have a grain of
genuine liberty in your composition, if you are not steeled
against the feelings of humanity, lost to every sense of
gratitude, and deaf to the cries of the injured, you will search
and probe the very inmost recesses of these infamous
transactions; and, if possible, totally eradicate the
cause.&nbsp; But I fear the root has taken too fast a hold to be
removed by your utmost efforts; indeed you may lop the branches,
and prune the sprouts, but nothing less than a parliamentary aid
can destroy the trunk; or at least, to make any tolerable figure
or progress in the business, the chief justice must exert his
abilities and power, or all yours will prove little less than
abortive and fruitless.&nbsp; But as it is not a sufficient
excuse for neglecting a part, because we cannot accomplish the
whole, I shall point out to you a few inconveniencies, which may
in some degree be remedied or prevented in future.</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>You are
to take care that eligible bail is not, on any <span
class="smcap">Pretence</span>, rejected; for the laws have put it
out of the sheriffs power to refuse such bail as <span
class="GutSmall">APPEAR</span> responsible for the debt at the
<span class="smcap">Time</span> it is offered, nor does the law
call on the sheriff, should such bail subsequently become
insolvent; notwithstanding the contrary doctrine of bailiffs and
pettyfogging attornies.</p>
<p>You are to take care, that for a bail-bond to a bill of
Middlesex, that one guinea <i>per</i> hundred is not extorted,
which is the common practice.</p>
<p>You should totally abolish the imposition of making a prisoner
pay half a crown, but oftener five shillings, for searching the
office of Middlesex; which is a tax founded on no better
authority than the mutual cheat of bailiff and clerk in
office.</p>
<p>You should take care, that no blank warrants go out of the
office till the receipt of the king&rsquo;s writ.</p>
<p>You should take care, that such writs are sealed before you
grant a warrant on them.</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>You
should take care, that such writs are not altered after
sealing.</p>
<p>You should take care, when more persons than one are included
in a writ, that no more than one is put in a warrant.</p>
<p>You should constitute a sworn appraiser of reputation, and
take security for his integrity in the appraisement of all such
goods as are seized by virtue of execution.</p>
<p>You should prevent clerks in office accepting presents from
bailiffs, as such presents cannot be for the public good.</p>
<p>You should take care, that plaintiff and defendant are not
<span class="GutSmall">BOTH</span> charged with the expence of
arrest, and that too by treble fees.</p>
<p>You should appoint proper persons in Middlesex to take
bail-bonds, the same as in London; but under better
regulations.</p>
<p>You should appoint a proper person to superintend
lock-up-houses twice a week, and make returns of such prisoners
as remain for want of bail, and the names <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>of such bail
as <span class="GutSmall">HAVE</span> been by them <span
class="GutSmall">OFFERED</span> to the bailiff.</p>
<p>You should regulate the expence of lock-up-houses, and have
those regulations hung up for the <span
class="smcap">Inspection</span> of prisoners.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">You should prevent any officer keeping a
Lock-up-house</span>, <span class="smcap">or having any interest
therein</span>.</p>
<p>To enumerate <span class="GutSmall">ALL</span> the frauds and
artifices practised by these <i>gentlemen</i> would swell this
Letter to a voluminous size.&nbsp; Suffice it therefore, that I
have pointed out more malpractices than you will easily rectify,
or could have comprehended from <span
class="GutSmall">COMMON</span> report, notwithstanding you
conceived them to be both numerous and flagrant.</p>
<p>Having thus far shewn what is practised in open defiance of
all laws human and divine, it will not be improper to remark how
far these outrages are carefully prohibited by the strict letter
of the laws now in force.</p>
<p>No arrest is lawful, unless the bailiff absolutely lay his
hand on the defendant; for the writs express arrest by the words
<span class="smcap">Capias</span>, <span
class="smcap">Attachias</span>, that is, to take and catch-hold;
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>therefore,
breaking open doors to make an arrest is no more lawful than
breaking them to commit a burglary; for every act of violence is
unlawful till the arrest be made and complete.</p>
<p>No arrest in civil cases is to be made with violence, by
breaking open doors, unless when regular possession shall be
recovered of any house, and the defendant happens to be in <span
class="smcap">such House</span>.&nbsp; Therefore bailiffs enter
at their peril, and the defendant is justifiable in putting him
to death in the very instant he <span
class="GutSmall">ATTEMPTS</span> to raise a latch; for it would
be absurd to suppose the laws will protect a man in the
commission of an unlawful act.</p>
<p>Any bailiff <span class="GutSmall">MALICIOUSLY</span>
arresting any person, where no cause of action is, shall suffer
six months imprisonment, and shall pay treble damages, with a
forfeiture of 10l. before he is discharged.</p>
<p>No bailiff shall take more fees than what the law allows upon
pain of incurring a penalty of 40l. with treble damages, to the
party aggrieved.</p>
<p>Attachment lies against him for executing <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>a writ <span
class="GutSmall">OPPRESSIVELY</span> by <span
class="smcap">Force</span>, <span class="smcap">Extortion</span>,
or in any <span class="GutSmall">CORRUPT</span> manner.</p>
<p>But our laws have originally considered sheriffs only
ostensible for the due execution of writs, and therefore take
little notice of their deputies, but make him answerable for
<span class="GutSmall">THEIR</span> acts in a ministerial
capacity; and equitably so, for the law supposes him capable of
avoiding evils of this nature by chusing proper persons.</p>
<p>We will now consider what provision the laws have made against
Barratry and other iniquitous practices of pettyfogging
attornies, from whom all the other grievances, either positively
or negatively, spring.&nbsp; My lord Coke thus defines a
Barrator; <i>that he is a common mover and maintainer of suits in
disturbance of the peace</i>, <i>and in taking and detaining the
possession of houses</i>, <i>lands</i>, <i>and goods by false
inventions</i>, <i>and therefore the indictment against him</i>
<span class="GutSmall">OUGHT</span> <i>to be in these words</i>;
viz. that he is, <span class="smcap">Communious
Malefactor</span>, <span class="smcap">Calumniator</span>, &amp;
<span class="smcap">Seminator Litium</span>, &amp; <span
class="smcap">Discordiarum inter Vicinos suos</span> &amp; <span
class="smcap">Paces Regis Perturbator</span>, &amp;c. &amp;c.
which is saying, that a barrator or pettyfogger is the most
dangerous oppressor in the law; for he oppresseth the innocent
under <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>colour of that law which was made to protect them from
oppression; and yet we have 500 of these barrators or
pettyfoggers in the courts at Westminster every term, in the full
exercise of their depredations, notwithstanding the laws
expressly pronounce the following sentence against them; viz.
&ldquo;that they shall be rendered incapable of acting as
attornies.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Attornies must produce receipts from under
the hands of council, or other persons receiving fees, if
requested by their clients, or they shall not be allowed them;
and attornies must give in to their clients a true bill, under
their own hand-writing, of all such fees, &amp;c. one month
before any action shall be brought against their clients for the
same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No attorney shall delay his client&rsquo;s suit from
any advantage to himself, or demand more than his due fees and
disbursements, under pain of a fine and disability to act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any attorney shall suffer any other person to
prosecute any suit in his name, he shall forfeit 20l.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any attorney&rsquo;s bill, upon taxation, be reduced
a <span class="GutSmall">SIXTH</span> part, he shall pay a
penalty <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>of
50l. and be disabled from acting as an attorney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any who have been convicted of perjury, forgery,
&amp;c. shall practise as an attorney or solicitor in any suit or
action, the judge, where such action shall be brought, hath power
to transport the offender for seven years, under such pains and
penalties as other felons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any attorney shall procure a blank warrant from any
sheriff, with intent to arrest, before a writ is delivered, he
shall be expelled and punished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every attorney must enter and file a warrant of
attorney in the suit he is employed to prosecute, under the
penalty of 10l.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney must file his in the
term he declares, and the defendants his in the term he
appears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no attorney shall appear or plead a plea, without a
warrant from his client.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notwithstanding our laws abound with these and many more
excellent provisions in behalf of the subjects at large, by
prescribing <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>limits to the power, and inforcing the duty, of
attornies, we daily feel their inefficiency to protect our
liberty and property, a proof that human foresight is unequal to
the task of guarding against the invention and chicanery of
necessitous villany.</p>
<p>However, as the evils arise not so much from the <span
class="smcap">Defect</span> of our laws as from a <span
class="smcap">Breach</span> of them, there is a firm bottom to
proceed on, and from your insatiable hatred to oppression, we may
hope to see some wholesome regulations in the sheriffs
department.&nbsp; The judicious choice of Mr. Reynolds, as
under-sheriff, will greatly facilitate a remedy to these growing
complaints; from whom, as a man and friend to the community, we
have every thing to hope&mdash;as an able lawyer, nothing to
doubt.</p>
<p>Lock-up-houses, <span class="GutSmall">EMPHATICALLY</span>
called spunging-houses, were originally instituted for the mutual
benefit and advantage of debtor and creditor, as a kind of
interlocutory residence or respite from a prison, which gave to
the former a lotted time to procure sureties for his appearance,
raise money or friends to pay the debt, or otherwise settle the
matter; with like opportunity to the latter to consider of and
consult his own interest.&nbsp; Thus far it became a humane <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>and equitable
institution; but, <span class="smcap">O Tempora</span>! <span
class="smcap">O Mores</span>! how subverted are the
lock-up-houses of this day: the instant a debtor enters one of
these confines, a temporary hell presents itself.&nbsp; He is
hemmed in and surrounded by a set of wretches, whose daily bread
depends on the misfortunes of others; on the one side he hears
pettyfoggers reading lectures on the <span
class="smcap">Theory</span> of vice, on the other, bailiffs
urging the necessity of its <span class="smcap">Practice</span>;
before him are raigned the unhappy pupils, industriously
improving on their infernal precepts, and rendering fraud,
perjury, rapine, and every degree of robbery, as mechanical as
shoe-making; behind stands a female <i>Anodyne</i>, bloated with
all the infections purged from her sex, her heart ulcerated with
vice, and her face with brandy, railing at the cruelty of
creditors, and <i>piously</i> banding off <i>comfort</i> to his
misfortunes, by holding out <i>advice</i> pernicious as
Eve&rsquo;s apple, a taste of which would entail misery on his
whole posterity.</p>
<p>A spunging-house, in its present state, is as destructive to
the principles of a man, as a brothel to the chastity of a woman;
both enter with an equal degree of timidity and terror, and are
seduced by similar stages of viciousness.&nbsp; The former, who
held it a <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>dishonour to delay payment of his bill with punctuality,
will, after a month&rsquo;s residence in a spunging-house, from
hellish tenets and execrable examples, think it meritorious to
cheat every creditor he has.&nbsp; The latter, who held the least
obscenity offensive to her ear, will, from a like mode of
seduction, and abominable examples, not only endure the sound,
but court the substance.&nbsp; Most certain it is, that the seeds
of vice are alike plentifully sown in these diabolical
seminaries, and the hand of authority only can prevent its
increase.&nbsp; But it appears, that these abuses committed by
sheriffs officers are not wholly recent or local; for so long
since as the year 1413 we find an act, in the first year of Henry
the Fifth, to prevent abuses, extortions, and oppressions of
bailiffs; which act runs thus: &ldquo;Forasmuch as the
king&rsquo;s liege people dare not prosecute or complain of the
extortions or oppressions to them done by the <i>bailiffs</i> of
sheriffs, because that the said bailiffs of sheriffs be so
continually year after year abiding with the sheriffs,
interchangeably in one office or in another, our lord the king,
by the advice and assent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and
at the <i>special</i> instance and <i>special</i> request of the
commons of this realm, hath ordained <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>and established, <span
class="smcap">That they who be Bailiffs or Sheriffs by one Year
shall be in no such Office by three Years next
following</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But by this and a subsequent act the bailiffs of such
sheriffs, whose sheriffwicks are <i>inheritable</i>, are
excepted.&nbsp; Now the lord mayor and citizens of London have
the sheriffalty of London and Middlesex in fee by charter;
therefore the bailiffs come within the above exception.&nbsp; The
acts themselves are affirmative, and the exception consequently
leaves a negative pregnant, which gives the sheriff full power to
discharge such bailiffs under sheriffwicks <i>inheritable</i>, as
if the acts had made no exceptions.</p>
<p>A removal then of the officers, or at least the greatest part
of them, is the first step towards a reformation; and the more
effectually to eradicate the evil, as far as your power will
extend, let them be replaced with men of moderate honesty and
morality.&nbsp; Chuse them as you do other officers of less
consequence, by ballot, election, &amp;c. such a mode of choice
will soon procure proper persons, and put the officers on a
reputable footing.&nbsp; There is nothing dishonourable in the
profession itself, more than in constable <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>or any other
minister of justice; the name of bailiff is become contemptible
<span class="GutSmall">ONLY</span> from a notion, that none are
such but those totally destitute of every spark of humanity and
honesty.&nbsp; Sheriffs themselves are royal officers of great
dignity, taking place even of noblemen in the county during their
sheriffalty.&nbsp; Can it then be supposed, that the immediate
deputies of an officer, whom the law honours with a judicial and
ministerial jurisdiction, almost to unlimited power, should be
composed of men too infamous for any other employment, such <a
name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a> only as are excluded from all social
and friendly societies of men?&nbsp; However it would be
extremely unjust, and argue a want of candour and common charity,
to indiscriminately confound the good with the bad, or make the
whole answerable for the crimes of a part.</p>
<p>Amidst such a body of men, it is to be hoped that exceptions
are not wanting; but I will venture to say, that those exceptions
will chiefly be found in the serjeants at mace, some of whom have
been reputable tradesmen, and still retain a memory of their own
misfortunes, which serves to keep the faculties <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>of feeling
and humanity in a proper circulation, and makes them view the
precipice from which they fell through the miseries of
others.</p>
<p>But as it does not become my purpose or province to select the
guilty from the innocent, I will leave them to stand justified by
their own works, as they pass your more critical observation; all
I contend for at present, is <span class="smcap">the Veracity of
this short Narrative</span>, <span class="smcap">in which I have
not related or alluded to a single Transaction but I can
authenticate with aggravating Circumstances</span>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Let then the proof of past Injuries be my
Task</span>, <span class="smcap">a Prevention of the future
yours</span>.&nbsp; From the foregoing observations we may fairly
conclude, that the present mode of holding the person of
house-keepers in trade to bail, is no more beneficial to
creditors than reputable to debtors, even supposing such arrest
to be thoroughly consonant with the law of the land.</p>
<p>But to quit the legality, and turn to the equity and policy of
confining the body of a debtor.&nbsp; There can be no reason
given agreeable to humanity or christianity, why one party only
should be punished for a crime, if <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>two concur in the guilt.&nbsp; The
creditor that gives improper credit, with a view of exorbitant
gain, meets the debtor half way in the fraud by the very act of
trust.&nbsp; In the former it is premeditated fraud and avarice,
in the latter rashness and folly.&nbsp; It is for his own sake
that the creditor gives credit, and his hope of advantage begets
a confidence in the creditor.&nbsp; As the contract or cause is
mutual, so ought the consequence.</p>
<p>We have seen one generation after another imprisoned for debts
they could not pay; and experience daily teaches, that a prison,
so far from affording a creditor&rsquo;s demand, shuts up, with
the debtor, every hope of recovering it.&nbsp; Why then should we
pursue the remedy without a benefit?&nbsp; If the debtor has
property, take it, and the end of arrest is fully answered.&nbsp;
If no such property is to be found, the want of it can be no
consolation to the debtor; and it is inhuman to add affliction on
the back of misfortunes.</p>
<p>If we search the prisons through, it will appear, that a vast
majority of prisoners are such from the villanies of attornies,
the injustice of creditors, or from a disability to pay such
debts as ought not, from the nature of their contract, to be
paid.&nbsp; The just, <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>fair, and honest man seldom imprisons
his debtor for a want of abilities so much as for want of
inclination.&nbsp; In the latter case, imprisonment is too
slender a punishment for the offence, in the former too harsh and
severe.</p>
<p>I am not so liberty-bit as to contend for it in behalf of a
man, who has wasted his creditors substance by every act of
dissipation and profligacy; but there certainly ought to be a
line drawn between the fraudulent and honest debtor: the one
merits a more exemplary correction than the laws inflict, the
other claims not only the law&rsquo;s protection, but the aid of
humanity.</p>
<p>The misery attending debtors would be often avoided, if
creditors would <span class="GutSmall">DEIGN</span> to see and
treat with them, instead of sending an attorney, whose hearts in
general are not made of penetrable stuff; to hope for mercy from
them, is putting your finger in the fire and begging it not to
burn.</p>
<p>Attornies fees amount to ten or fifteen pounds by suing a
debtor to execution, and by making terms to avoid it as many
shillings only; it is therefore absurd to suppose an attorney
would advise an amicable adjustment.</p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>As I
have in the course of these confused and indigested observations
pointed out the several abuses of attornies and bailiffs, with
their several remedies, I shall endeavour to shew the reason why
these remedies remain unapplied, and why such atrocious offences
escape the vigilance, energy, and force of so many statutes
framed for their detection, and upon a strict enquiry we shall
find the evil under two general heads.</p>
<p>These outrages are mostly practised on such objects as are in
a defenceless situation, and constrained to silence from their
inabilities to complain.&nbsp; If, <i>per contra</i>, the
oppressed person saves enough out of the wreck to make
application, it is made under these disadvantageous
circumstances.&nbsp; An attorney of integrity and reputation as
studiously shuns a contest with miscreants, so loaded with
infamy, as they would an epidemical contagion; on the other hand,
an attorney of the same stamp renders the remedy infinitely worse
than the disease.&nbsp; The relief obtained from such an advocate
serves but to involve and plunge the complainant in a more horrid
gulph of distress, by picking his pocket of every shilling he can
procure, and afterwards selling his cause to the infamous
defendant.&nbsp; This is a truth fatally <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>felt by one
half of the world, and acknowledged by the other.</p>
<p>Surely then the interest and honor of the profession is deeply
engaged in the extirpation of these disgraceful nuisances to
<span class="GutSmall">THEIR</span> community; a small degree of
<span class="GutSmall">THEIR</span> exertion would brush these
asps from the face of the earth, which now buzz and sting, to the
annoyance of every less offensive member of society.</p>
<p>To say that this great end is not easy to accomplish, is folly
and cowardice in the extreme.&nbsp; A proper knowledge in the
laws, joined to a little spirit and resolution, would absolutely
bring the whole artillery of pettyfoggers to capitulate at least,
and we should see them reduced to the alternative of living by
the fair practice, or seeking some other profession.</p>
<p>Is it not enough to put the whole body of law out of
countenance, when I positively aver to their teeth, that, with
the assistance of the laws now in force, and an able attorney of
spirit and character, I would undertake to render these horrid
transactions impracticable, with impunity, for the future.</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>But
what can we expect, when our most eminent pleaders will view a
monstrous gigantic villany stalking on the verge of his brief,
and will not step out of his <i>methodical</i> path to catch
it?&nbsp; Have we not heard an orator exclaim, <i>Your lordships
are well acquainted with the abilities of this man</i>, <i>this
quire of affidavits are of his manufactory</i>, <i>the credit of
which</i>, <i>my lords</i>, <i>will render an explanation of the
matter unnecessary</i>?</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the known and established character of the
solicitor in question, the very next cause we see the same
eloquent gentleman take up the trowel and plaister of logic, and
completely cover the egregious blacking he bestowed on him half
an hour before.</p>
<p>It is not all the rhetorical eloquence, muttered from the
force of language, that can reconcile this absurdity to common
sense.&nbsp; The man who was all infamy half an hour ago cannot
make so quick a transition; but on such paradoxes in law does the
safety and support of these Jeofails depend.</p>
<p>Much having been said about the peculiar qualifications and
abilities of a pettyfogging attorney, I shall conclude this
Letter with a <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>portrait of the most eminent one in this metropolis.</p>
<p>He keeps his <span class="smcap">Commons</span> with bailiffs,
knights of the pad and the post, and other <i>illustrious</i>
personages of equal <i>dignity</i>.&nbsp; He has most carefully
gleaned up all the little quirks and artifices in the law, which
being too few for his purpose, he has augmented the number with
some of his own invention.&nbsp; The fair practice he ever held
an uncertain revenue, and honesty a bar to wealth.&nbsp; A weak
conscience has disincumbered him of integrity, and a dislike to
poverty freed him from every grain of morality.&nbsp; Right and
wrong claim no distinction, but as they severally serve his
interest.&nbsp; Justice and injustice bear the same
<i>convenient</i> equality.&nbsp; It would be matter of wonder
should a man, so happily equipped for advancement, miss
success.&nbsp; We now find him armed, <i>cap-&agrave;-pe</i>,
with writs of error, reverse of judgments, sham pleas and
demurrers, and Nature&rsquo;s great design fully answered in his
creation.&nbsp; She bestowed knavery with a lavish hand; the
addition of solicitor and scrivenor has stamped him pettyfogger
in every limb.&nbsp; His penetration is superior to most mens;
the first fee enables him to pronounce the cause <i>just</i>, the
second amounts to <i>inspiration</i>, and <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>a third shall
decree his client the kingdom of <span
class="smcap">Mexico</span>, if he wants it.&nbsp; Find but
money, and he will find title.&nbsp; Let him finger a purse, and
he will out-run the lawyer in the fable, who ate the oyster and
left his client the shell; our pettyfogger will swallow the one
and pocket the other.&nbsp; He is the <span
class="smcap">Hy&aelig;na</span> <a name="citation39"></a><a
href="#footnote39" class="citation">[39]</a> of the law, at whose
hideous howl the other curs are dumb.&nbsp; His appetite for
villany is most voracious, and in time we may hope to see him,
like <span class="smcap">Aaron&rsquo;s</span> serpent, devouring
every poisonous reptile of his own species.&nbsp; His conscience
never takes a general view of his actions, but occasionally peeps
when he handles the New Testament.&nbsp; In that moment his whole
frame shakes from its center, and his soul seems agitated, as if
pregnant with the murder of the twelve apostles.&nbsp; He is a
remarkable instance of God&rsquo;s love for the creation; to warn
mankind against the wiles of his tongue, Infinite Goodness has
set a token of deception in his countenance.&nbsp; In his face we
have a perfect index to his heart, each feature is a hieroglyphic
expressive of horrid crimes beyond the reach of language.&nbsp;
Perjury has so infected his breath, <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>that he omits grace at his meals to
avoid tainting the meat.&nbsp; He is a <span
class="smcap">Judas</span> in every thing but remorse; his
insatiable avarice secures him from repentance, and he esteems
not gold the less as being the price of <span
class="smcap">Blood</span>.&nbsp; He seems to have the gift of
divinity, so far as to prophesy his own end; and therefore keeps
a monitor <a name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a> in the house to remind him <span
class="smcap">Hanging</span> is not repealed.&nbsp; Quirks,
subterfuges, and evasions having kindly lugged him through his
filthy life, as a mark of his gratitude he will remember them in
his death; so that when the last trumpet sounds to judgment, like
<span class="smcap">Quevedo&rsquo;s</span> lawyer, he will <span
class="GutSmall">DEMUR</span>, under pretence that the
proceedings were wrong from his creation, he having a soul not
made for a human body.</p>

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
